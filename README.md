### This code is mainly based on the PyTorch framework to reproduce the RMT model, which includes the RetNet model and the RMT attention module. With this implementation you can easily use it to train and validate your own datasets.
### There is still a lot of places for optimization in this code. If you have any good suggestions, you are welcome to give them to me.

## Train and evaluate the RMT-model
1. cd RetNet_ViT
2. python train_gpu.py
